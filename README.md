# Surviving-Titanic

This project from Codecademy is about implementing a Logistic Regression model to predict whether if passengers will survive the sinking of the Titanic. The dataset has 895 rows and 12 columns but I only used 4 columns: age, sex, first class and second class. The training model's accuracy score is about 81% and the testing model's accruacy score is about 76%.
